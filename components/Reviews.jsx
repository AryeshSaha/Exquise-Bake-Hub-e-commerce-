          This is my third Invicta Pro Diver. They are just fantastic value for
          money. This one arrived yesterday and the first thing I did was set
          the time, popped on an identical strap from another Invicta and went
          in the shower with it to test the waterproofing.... No problems.

          It is obviously not the same build quality as those very expensive
          watches. But that is like comparing a Citroën to a Ferrari. This watch
          was well under £100! An absolute bargain.
